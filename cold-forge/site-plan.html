      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will be focused mainly on introducing clients or customers to the idea behind my service. I help introduce youth to a social environment that may feel more familiar to them as video games are more popular than ever. For the youth I can introduce them to the games or activities they’d have to look forward to, and the parents I would highlight the benefits of this socializing, then expanding it to explain more details and direct further traffic to the FAQ to answer more questions and the Rates page to show available prices and rates.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

        <img class="demo" src="images/home_games.jpg" alt="image showing people playing">

      </ul>
      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        In the FAQ I look to answer questions about what time the youth would play, how long, what games, etc. I would also continue providing information regarding my past as a teacher, youth leader, and primary instructor. I would continue to update the page as new questions were asked.

      </ul>
      <h3>Rates</h3>
      <p>
        For the Rates page it’s fairly simple, I will cover the rates I charge, this may vary based on how many people are looking for specific days or times. For instance in general Saturdays are quite popular, many people will be interested, but if too many people are interested in the same day and time the pricing and scheduling will be confusing. On this page I will help explain it to the visitor.

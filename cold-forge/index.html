    <h1>Welcome to <br>Cold Forge</h1>
    <p>I am Scott Doyle and I am a professional Game Master, I introduce groups to Table Top RPGs such as Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder. In these Role Playing Games, players will engage with creative writing and teambuilding excercizes as they create their characters and interact with the world they are placed in.</p>

    <h2>TTRPGs</h2>
    <p>A Table Top Role Playing Game is a game where a group of players create characers to act out, like an actor improvising a character. At every table the game is played differently, with house rules or home made systems, each campaign is it's own world that the players create together.</p>

    <h2>My Services</h2>
    <p>As a Game Master I introduce players to the system and the game world or campaign. I ensure the players learn the basics of how to engage with the game as well as working together with the other players, it would be difficult to play a sport alone and it's the same here.</p>
